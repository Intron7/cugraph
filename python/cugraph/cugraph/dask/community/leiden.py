    Compute the modularity optimizing partition of the input graph using the
    Leiden method

    Traag, V. A., Waltman, L., & van Eck, N. J. (2019). From Louvain to Leiden:
    guaranteeing well-connected communities. Scientific reports, 9(1), 5233.
    doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z

    This runs the same algorithm as `cugraph.leiden`, with the same
    guarantees: every returned community is connected, the returned
    modularity is exact, and the result is deterministic. The current
    multi-GPU implementation gathers the whole graph onto every GPU and runs
    the single-GPU algorithm on every worker, so the graph must fit on one
    GPU (about 40 bytes per stored edge for int32 vertex ids and float32
    weights). Given the internal vertex numbering of the graph, the result
    does not depend on the number of workers: it is bitwise identical to
    `cugraph.leiden` on a graph with the same internal numbering and the
    same `random_state`. A distributed graph is always renumbered internally
    (also with ``renumber=False``), so `cugraph.dask.leiden` and
    `cugraph.leiden` on the same input generally return different, equally
    valid partitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_graph : cugraph.Graph
        The graph descriptor should contain the connectivity information
        and weights. The adjacency list will be computed if not already
        present.
        The current implementation only supports undirected graphs. The
        weights must be finite and non-negative; an unweighted graph uses
        weight 1 for every edge. Self-loops and edges of weight 0 are
        ignored, and the parallel edges of a MultiGraph are summed. The
        number of vertices must be less than 2**30.

    max_iter : integer, optional (default=None)
        Deprecated and ignored: Leiden runs `n_iterations` iterations, each
        with as many levels as it needs, so this cap on the number of levels
        is no longer needed. Passing a value emits a FutureWarning. It will
        be removed in a future release.

    resolution: float, optional (default=1.0)
        Called gamma in the modularity formula, this changes the size
        of the communities.  Higher resolutions lead to more smaller
        communities, lower resolutions lead to fewer larger communities.
        Must be finite and in [0, 2**20]. Defaults to 1.

    random_state: int, optional(default=None)
        Seed of the hashes that randomize the order of the local moves. Only
        its low 32 bits are used, and it is the same for every worker. The
        partition depends on the seed and on the internal vertex numbering
        of `input_graph`; repeated calls on the same graph with the same
        seed return the same partition. Defaults to a hash of process id,
        time, and hostname.

    theta: float, optional (default=None)
        Deprecated and ignored: it was never used by the implementation (see
        `beta`). Passing a value emits a FutureWarning. It will be removed
        in a future release.

    n_iterations: int, optional (default=2)
        Keyword-only. Number of Leiden iterations (as in igraph: every
        iteration restarts from the partition of the previous one). Must be
        >= 1, or -1 to iterate until the partition is stable: until an
        iteration moves no vertex or improves the modularity by less than
        1e-6, at most 20 iterations. Two iterations are recommended.

    beta: float, optional (default=0.0)
        Keyword-only. Randomness of the refinement phase (beta of Traag et
        al.). Reserved: only 0 (merge along the best edge) is implemented;
        a value > 0 raises NotImplementedError.

    Returns
    -------
    parts : dask_cudf.DataFrame
        GPU data frame of size V containing two columns the vertex id and the
        partition id it is assigned to.

        ddf['vertex'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the vertex identifiers
        ddf['partition'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the partition assigned to the vertices. Partitions are
            numbered 0, 1, ... in order of decreasing size.

    modularity_score : float
        The modularity of the partition, computed exactly (in double
        precision) for the given resolution, self-loops excluded (see
        `cugraph.leiden`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import cugraph.dask as dcg
    >>> import dask_cudf
    >>> # ... Init a DASK Cluster
    >>> #    see https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/stable/dask-cugraph.html
    >>> # Download dataset from https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph/datasets/..
    >>> chunksize = dcg.get_chunksize(datasets_path / "karate.csv")
    >>> ddf = dask_cudf.read_csv(datasets_path / "karate.csv",
    ...                          blocksize=chunksize, delimiter=" ",
    ...                          names=["src", "dst", "value"],
    ...                          dtype=["int32", "int32", "float32"])
